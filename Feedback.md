Great work Leo!

I really think that the application is coming together really well.

A few points that I wanted to comment on:

1 - Great work on creating a separate file to generalize UI configurations like the time formatter. 

2 - Fantastic work on creating separate View/ViewModels and folders. That can be really useful in the future.

3 - I've left a few comments throughout the code about force casting, and force unwrapping, try to adapt these areas to avoid unintended crashes.

4 - I noticed that when we come back to the main screen, the started timers reset. Was that intentional? If you want to persist them while in the main screen too, we may need to adapt the logic a bit.

5 - Great idea in using a json to persist the data, another option could be to use coredata/user defaults, which are native solutions on iOS. If you have the time, implementing one of these could demonstrate to reviewers that you know how to handle them too.

Again, great work, looking forward to seeing the finished application.
